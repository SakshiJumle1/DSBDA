a. 1D (Linear) Data Visualization
Iris: Plot a histogram of PetalLengthCm to see its distribution.
Adult:
Plot a bar chart of education or income to show frequency.

b. 2D (Planar) Data Visualization
Iris:Use a scatter plot of SepalLengthCm vs SepalWidthCm, colored by Species.
Adult:Plot hours.per.week vs age, colored by income.

c. 3D (Volumetric) Data Visualization
Iris:X-axis: PetalLengthCm, Y-axis: PetalWidthCm, Size or Color: SepalLengthCm, colored by Species.
Adult:X: age, Y: hours.per.week, Color: education.num, colored by income.

e. Multidimensional Data Visualization
Iris:Use a scatter matrix or dashboard showing pairwise plots.
Adult:Combine age, hours, income, education, and occupation in a scatter plot with color, shape, and size encoding.

f. Tree/Hierarchical Data Visualization
Adult:Use Tree Map for native.country > occupation > income.
Iris:Create a synthetic hierarchy: Species > PetalLengthCm Range.
